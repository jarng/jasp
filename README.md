# Pathfinding Visualizer

A simple visualizer for commonly used pathfinding algorithms. I wanted to build this project because I was curious about how pathfinding algorithms work and I wanted visualize them in action, as well as to learn more about the algorithms themselves.

The project is built in plain JS and CSS, no fancy tech or UI, just a simple grid and some buttons.

## Algorithms available

- Dijkstra
- A\*
- BFS
- DFS

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo and open with live server.
2. That's probably it.

## TODO

- Add more algorithms
- Add maze generation algorithms
- Interactive maze generation
